Donation system is an open source project to help non profit organizations to easily collect and manage one-off and recurring donations via credit card, invoice or other payment methods. The project is being developed to help Amigos da Poli with the challenge making donations interface user friendly and easier to manage. 

Here is how the system will initially work: one page where donors can fill in information and register a one-off or a recurring donation and an admin page where the non profit fundraising responsible is able to easily consolidate all donation to the organization. 

The goal of this project is to help other endowment funds and non profits in general to have an effective and low cost donation system. As an open source project, we expect it can also help other non profit organizations to leverage financial resources and increase its impact in society.

Now, configure you stuff in the env file (`.env`)
```

If you have to, you may also change some option for the postgres service: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/

```
The first time, since the image isn't in the docker hub, it'll take some time.
The server will the be accessible in the URL `localhost:8000`
